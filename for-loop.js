  // The first part, var i = 0, is run once at the beginning of the loop. The  
  // variable i is used to track how many times the loop has run.  
   
  // The second part, i < 10, is checked at the beginning of every loop  
  // iteration before running the code inside the loop. If the statement is  
  // true, the code inside the loop is executed. If it is false, then the loop  
  // is complete. The statement i < 10; indicates that the loop will continue  
  // as long as i is less than 10.  
   
  // The final part, i++, is executed at the end of every loop. This increases  
  // the variable i by 1 after each loop. Once i reaches 10, the loop will  
  // exit.
